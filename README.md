# Monopoly

This is meant to be 
1) fun
2) fun
3) fun

and hopefully get to learn some ideas and break some preconceptions we have.

Idea will be to split into working groups of 2 or more pairs/mobs of devs
Figure out between you what to pickup and how to get going

Please dont just figure ou thow to avoid each other - the fun in this will come when tests are overlapping on feature set.
I have a suspicion it will all just work - but if it doesnt then you will need to communicate and i think that 
in itself is a great thing to practise (cross mob)

## Movement rules

 - A game has up to 4 players
 - A board can have varying number of playing spaces.
 - Players take turns to roll and then move that many spaces on the board
 - if a player lands on another player the player that is landed on goes back to the start at the beginning of their next go
 - if a third player lands on 2 players then the 2 players get to mug that player, take half of the player money and split it.
 - if a player rolls double that player gets another go
 - if the player rolls a double an dlands on a player after the extra roll then that play looses a go
 - when a player rolls a 4 an lands on start each of the other players gets to choose a community chest card and apply it to that player
 - If a player lands 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 of the way aroudn the board they get to pick up a community card

## Bank Rules

 - Players start with 500
 - Every time I player passes the start that player gets 200
 - A player can take out a loan that accrues interest at 5% per board rotation
 - EveryTime you pass Start you pay 20% tax on income
 - Player Who has 0 money looses game
 

## Property

 - Each space on a baord contains a piec eof property
 - It can be bought by a player for the amount on the card
 - If a player doesnt purchase it then it goes up for auction and noather play is allowed to buy it
   - the highest bidder gets it
 - If a player lands on a space that is owned by another player that player gets to charge rent
   - These transactions must go via the bank as the bank tracks income tax (wierd rules to stop corporate tax evasion - apparently its hard to stop it)
 - players can sell properties for half their value to the bank
 - players can purchase sold properties from the bank at 2* face value
 - players can deposit money in bank and earn interest at 0.01%
 - after every player finishes a loop the values of property go up by 4% and rents by 6%

## Community chest
 - Players can sell community chest cards to the back for 50
 - Players can buy sold cards for 100 
 - miss a turn
 - community cards have toi interact with at least one of (players position relative to other player son the board, player bank balances - not necessarily of the player who landed on it, property values, interest rate values)
 - make some thing sup that are fun - but they need to integrate
